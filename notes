Data Structures:

what is TypedDict (from typing package)?
it let's us define dictionaries with a fixed structure, where each key has a specific expected type (similar to objects in c).

example:

class Person(TypedDict):
    name: str
    age: int

#dict creation
p: Person = {
    "name": "wael"# same as below
    "age": 27 #anything other than int gives error (static)
}

----------------------------
Python:

-what is def __init__(...)?

a dunder method that runs automatically right after you create an object from class. its job is to initialize the object as it's created
example:
class Dog:
    def __init__(self, name, age):
        self.name = name
        self.age = age
dog = Dog("X", 10)
print(dog.name) #output is X

-what's a variable of this sort "self._var, self._x"?

    these are instance variables, they store data that belongs to that specific object.
    the underscore before the variable's name means it's protected / internal use only 

-------------------------------
General:

what are race conditions?

    two or more tasks access the same data at the same time
